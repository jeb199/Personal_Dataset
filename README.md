DATA 115 Personal Dataset Project

Motivation:

My motivation for this project was music trends. More specifically how different songs compare and contrast to one another and if there are any trends between songs of all genres. I wanted to see if there were any trends shared between genres completely opposite to each other, for example rap and orchestra, and if there were any shared between all genres as a whole.

Process:

To visualize these music trends, I first had to find what dataset I wanted to use and what better than my own playlist. I decided to use my large playlist on Pandora, since it has over 1,300 songs and almost any genre you could imagine. To make sure the data I pulled was completely unbiased, I shuffled my playlist and picked the first 50 songs that appeared, that way it was random. From just selecting those songs off of the playlist, information such as song title, band name, and the length of the song were available instantly, so I entered that data into my excel dataset. Next, I picked some trends that the songs could have, including genre, monthly listeners, ranking of song, gender of lead singer, and more. I gathered most of this information from Spotify's "About" tab, and the ranking of song I gathered from Pandora, under the artist's tab, "Top Songs." Since all of my data was entered in by me and from my personal dataset, I had no cleaning processes I had to go through in order to finalize my raw data.

Visualization:

![Ranking of Song vs Monthly Listeners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeb199/Personal_Dataset/master/Music_DataChart.png)

This figure shows monthly listeners of the band compared to the ranking of the individual song. As you can see, the less popular the band is, the more I tend to listen to their top songs. And, as the bands grow in popularity, the more I branch out and listen to the less popular of their songs. However, there are a couple outliers. On the bottom right, there are two outliers which result because, although the band is unpopular, I listen to their really unpopular songs. Another outlier is towards the top left, which is due to a band that is really popular, but I didn't branch further into their music. While this visualization clearly has some outliers, there is also an obvious trend between monthly listeners and the ranking of the songs selected. And I'd assume that the wider range of songs selected, the more clear that trend would become.

Analysis:

One method from class I learned and applied to my own personal dataset was making a scatter plot of two columns, as seen in the section "Visualization."
