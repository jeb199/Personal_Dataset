DATA 115 Personal Dataset Project

Motivation:

My motivation for this project was music trends. More specifically how different songs compare and contrast to one another and if there are any trends between songs of all genres.I wanted to know if, for example, a rap songs have any similar trends to soft rock, or to heavy metal, or soul music. 

Process:

To visualize these music trends, I first had to find what dataset I wanted to use and what better than my own playlist. I decided to use my large playlist on Pandora, since it has over 1,300 songs and has almost any genre you could imagine. To make sure the data I pulled from my playlist was completely unbiased or skewed, I shuffled my playlist and picked the first 50 songs that appeared, that way it was random. From just selecting those songs off of the playlist, information such as song title, band name, and the length of the song were available, so I entered that data into my excel dataset. Next, I picked some trends that the songs could have, including genre, monthly listeners, ranking of song, gender of lead singer, and more. I gathered most of this information from Spotify's "About" tab and the ranking of song I gathered from Pandora, under the artist's tab "Top Songs." Since all of my data was entered in by me and from my personal dataset, I had no cleaning processes I had to go through.

This figure shows monthly listeners of the band compared to the ranking of the individual song.
